Chart functionality=
====================
- split into 10 minutes candles
- buttons to zoom per 1h, 6h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m, 6m
- selecting a candle will display all the trades in that period


- add unit tests to verify:
    - ChartDataConverter.get10MinutesChartElements
    - ChartDataConverter.get1HourChartElements

- for candlestick chart, leave only time intervals buttons and create the candlesticks according to those intervals
  Don't make the range customizable


DONE:
!attention:
- when adding new trades to the chart, they might not match with the already drawn chart. This is because some trade might fall in the 10 minutes
interval which was already drawn on the chart.

Market data functionality=
==========================
- create list of markets supported by XChange
- when application starts, for each market, run the R script to download each historical data
- when historical data is downloaded for market, save the timestamp and use XChange to download new market data using the APIs


Supported Trades====
====================

bitfinex
bitstamp

Bugs===
