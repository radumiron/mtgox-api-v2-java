Chart functionality=
====================
- split into 10 minutes candles
- buttons to zoom per 1h, 6h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m, 6m
- selecting a candle will display all the trades in that period


- add unit tests to verify:
    - ChartDataConverter.get10MinutesChartElements
    - ChartDataConverter.get1HourChartElements


!attention:
- when adding new trades to the chart, they might not match with the already drawn chart. This is because some trade might fall in the 10 minutes
interval which was already drawn on the chart.
