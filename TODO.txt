Chart functionality=
====================
- split into 10 minutes candles
- buttons to zoom per 1h, 6h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m, 6m
- selecting a candle will display all the trades in that period


- add unit tests to verify:
    - ChartDataConverter.get10MinutesChartElements
    - ChartDataConverter.get1HourChartElements

- change layout to PortalLayout

DONE:
!attention:
- when adding new trades to the chart, they might not match with the already drawn chart. This is because some trade might fall in the 10 minutes
interval which was already drawn on the chart.
- when connecting to a MongoDB, add your desired user to that schema

Market data functionality=
==========================
- create list of markets supported by XChange
- when application starts, for each market, run the R script to download each historical data
- when historical data is downloaded for market, save the timestamp and use XChange to download new market data using the APIs


Supported Trades====
====================
bitcoinaverage
bitcoincharts
bitcurex
bitfinex
bitstamp
btcchina
btce
campbx
cavirtex
kraken
mtgox
openxchangerates

Bugs===
=======
- the candles in the candlestick chart don't have the correct color/type (some of them are falling and displayed as rising)

Stress Testing===
=================
- 1 try - 03.02.2014
- 150 trades
- 20000 clients
=> all looking good, response time under 10 ms
=> server performance is good

- perpetual try - 03.02.2014
- maximum 1000 trades
- 50000 clients
=> response time varies from 100 ms to 1500 ms
=> server performance is good, but degrading
    - problems with CPU on MongoDB
